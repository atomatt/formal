	Added a ReSTTextArea widget. The widget accepts ReST-format input and
	includes a preview facility.

	Added a SelectOtherChoice widget. The widget is similar to the
	SelectChoice but includes an "Other ..." option and an <input> field to
	provide another value if the options in the list and not appropriate.

	Added ChangeLog. I should have done this a long time ago. Now I'll have to
	revisit the commit log and try to write something sensible here.
