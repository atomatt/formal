* Choice widget should compare the POSTed value to the blank value and
  replace it with None.


* Update widgets to decode to unicode instances immediately.


* Make sure generated forms are standards compliant.

    Right now, the form does not contain a fieldset :(.


* Validation should be extracted

    Create a validaton module with lots of validator classes, i.e. Required,
    Range, etc.
  

* Required fields are not highlighted

    Type should be checked for a required attribute or validator and a
    ''required'' CSS class should be set on the field's element.

    
* Mapping type


* Nested groups of fields (Structure)


* File type


* DateTime type


* RadioChoice widget


* MultipleSelect widget


* Allow different field label than the name


* Allow action button labels to be different to name


* Form callback is not used when an action is added.

    Because the actions are submit buttons the form's callback is not used even
    when the user hits enter and does not click a button.
    
    I'm not sure if this is correct or incorrect but it may be confusing to some
    users.

    
* Fully customisable form templates


* Improve the CSS

    Consider splitting into two stylesheets: layout and style. If possible,
    provide a couple of sets for common form styles.

    
* Add widgets for other HTML editors.

    HTMLArea, FCKEditor, Kupu.
    
    
* Form action URL splats and query parameters that the page was using.

    I'm not sure it's possible to manage this unless the form always uses POST
    and t.web or Nevow provides access to GET and POST vars.
