Steal ideas from (?):
    * http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/trimming_form_fields.html
    
    
custom pattern
    
    
interleave mode where you get to define lots of HTML and the forms.form weaves
itself in


more generic exception (than validation error) for just saying something failed.


something a little like ian bicking's htmlfill to accomplish my "weaving" idea.
i need to look at htlmfill more but i think it has some issues with things like
3-input data rendering. Perhaps instead of parsing the html the widgets should
*always* work by filling slots at various different levels - label + message +
<input> element(s) + description + value(s) + label, complete widget output,
complete group output etc.
